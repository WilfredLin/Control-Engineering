Electrical Network Representation:
-----------------------------------
1. Voltage Source (V)
2. Resistor (R)
3. Capacitor (C)
4. Inductor (L)
5. Nonlinear components (e.g., diodes, transistors)

Connections:
- Voltage source connects to the resistor (R1)
- Resistor (R1) connects to the capacitor (C1)
- Capacitor (C1) connects to the inductor (L1)
- Inductor (L1) connects back to the voltage source
- Nonlinear components can be placed in parallel or series with the above components

Circuit Analysis can be performed using:
- Kirchhoff's Laws
- Nodal Analysis
- Mesh Analysis
- Laplace Transform for dynamic analysis

Translational Mechanical System Representation:
----------------------------------------------
1. Mass (m)
2. Spring (k)
3. Damper (b)
4. Applied Force (F)

Connections:
- The mass (m) is connected to the spring (k) and damper (b).
- The spring is attached to a fixed point and the mass.
- The damper is also connected between the mass and the fixed point.
- An external force (F) is applied to the mass.

System Analysis can be performed using:
- Newton's Laws of Motion
- Free Body Diagrams
- Laplace Transform for dynamic analysis
